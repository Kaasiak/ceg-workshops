This repo contsists of a jupyter notebook for the CEG conference workshops (University of Warwick, August 2022)
The workshops are based on my work from the URSS 2021 summer research project, redesigned to make use of the `cegpy` [Python package](https://pypi.org/project/cegpy/). 

Workshop notebook with code and commentary available on binder [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Kaasiak/ceg-workshops/HEAD?labpath=ceg-workshops.ipynb).
